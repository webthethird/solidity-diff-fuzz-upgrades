# DiffUSC: Differential Fuzzing of Upgradeable Smart Contract Implementations

This project has two parts so far:

1. [A POC for differential fuzzing on the Compound Comptroller](contracts/test/compound/Comptroller-diff.sol), in order to trigger the [COMP token distribution bug](https://twitter.com/Mudit__Gupta/status/1443454940165263360) introduced in an upgrade following [governance proposal 62](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/62) in September 2021. This fuzz testing contract was manually written and requires setup (see below). The `build.sh` script deploys the entire Compound protocol twice using a fork of Compound's `compound-eureka` repo, saves the deployment transaction sequence to `echidna-init.json`, and stores the necessary addresses to `contracts/test/addresses.sol`.
    - A lot of this part (including most of this readme) is from the [solidity-fuzzing-boilerplate](https://github.com/patrickd-/solidity-fuzzing-boilerplate) template by [@patrickd](https://github.com/patrickd-).

2. DiffUSC, a tool for automatically generating differential fuzz testing contracts for comparing upgradeable smart contract implementations. The goal is to generalize the approach to detect unexpected discrepancies between any two implementation contracts, so as to prevent the introduction of bugs and vulnerabilities during a smart contract upgrade. The tool has two modes, basic '`path mode`' and '`fork mode`', with the mode used depending on how the input smart contracts are provided via the command line. 
    - `Path mode` works with file paths, and (optionally) deploys all target contracts in the test contract's constructor, though it may be necessary to add additional custom initialization logic by modifying the auto-generated code or using inheritance/overriding functions. 
    
    - `Fork mode` works with addresses of contracts that have already been deployed to a network, and requires an RPC endpoint URL to create two forks of the network. This requires less custom initialization, though it is slower due to the need for RPC queries and may be less flexible than custom initialization in some cases.

```

## Part 1: Setup

Before any fuzzing can be run, `build.sh` needs to be executed, which has the following dependencies:

- bash
- curl
- [etheno](https://github.com/crytic/etheno)
- [foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation.html)

After the buildscript was successfully executed, the addresses.sol contract should be populated, there'll be a `echidna-init.json` file and a ganache instance will still be running in the background.

## Part 1: Running Echidna Fuzzing

```bash
# Differential fuzzing with protocol deployment via initialization file:
echidna --contract ComptrollerDiffFuzz --config echidna.yaml contracts/test/compound/Comp-diff.sol
```

# Solidity Fuzzing Boilerplate

This is a template repository intended to ease fuzzing components of Solidity projects, especially libraries.

- Write tests once and run them with both [Echidna](https://github.com/crytic/echidna) and [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/fuzz-testing.html)'s fuzzing.
- Fuzz components that use incompatible Solidity versions by deploying those into a Ganache instance via Etheno.
- Use HEVM's FFI cheatcode to generate complex fuzzing inputs or to compare outputs with non-EVM executables while doing differential fuzzing.
- Publish your fuzzing experiments without worrying about licensing by extending the shellscript to download specific files.

## How to use the Template

### 1. Check & adjust configs

Check the [echidna.yaml](echidna.yaml) and [foundry.toml](foundry.toml) configuration files.

- Turn off FFI if you don't intend to make use of shell commands from your Solidity contracts. Note that FFI is slow and should only be used as a workaround. It can be useful for testing against things that are difficult to implement within Solidity and already exist in other languages. But it can also be dangerous: Before executing tests of a project that has FFI enabled, be sure to check what commands are actually being executed. There's nothing stopping someone to write a malicious testcase and execute malware on your computer.
- Adjust the compiler optimization options to match those of the project you're fuzzing.
- The default number of test runs configured, assumes that you intend to leave these tests running for a while to find edge cases, eg. on servers. Reduce the numbers accordingly if you only want to run quick tests.
- Adjust things like sequence lengths when fuzzing contracts that have a state (where a previous transaction can impact the next one).

### 2. Adjust Buildscript

Edit the [build.sh](build.sh) file and adjust it for your usecase

- Fetch the implementations that you want to apply fuzzing on.
- During RECORDing, deploy contracts of incompatible Solidity versions in order to access them during tests.
- If you're not dealing with any contracts of incompatible versions, you can simply omit the RECORD and DEPLOY calls.

### 3. Create testcases and exposers/interfaces as needed

Take a look at the [example testcases](contracts/test/example) and write your own.

### 4. Adjust the README.md

Don't forget to document the intention, setup and commands for your fuzzing campaign.
